gnu-trainer
===========

Script to setup emacs with consistent configuration on multiple OSes and distros.

To use you can download and run the [install file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liquid-Labs/gnu-trainer/master/bin/gnu-trainer) or by copying the following line into a terminal:

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Liquid-Labs/gnu-trainer/master/bin/gnu-trainer)
```

To Customize
------------

The current configuration used is rather simple and could use some fleshing out; feel free to suggest changes. If you want to go your own way, easy enough to fork. I considered adding a parameter to the setup script to allow it to point to alternate sources, but then figured better to keep it simple and just use git. Please do isolate and submit any general improvements to the [Liquid-Labs/gnu-trainer](https://github.com/Liquid-Labs/gnu-trainer) project.
